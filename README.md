# Tiva Launchpad RFID

The purpose of this project is to read RFID tags using a Tiva Launchpad Board EK-TM4C123GXL and a RFID RC522 reader, common within the arduino community. As is, the project is able to authenticate onto MIFARE cards if you know the keys. 

This project has many class based libraries that can be used for other projects, it also makes use of Tivaware libraries from Texas Instruments. The IDE used is Code Composer Studio.

This project is almost completed but since I relocated and I no longer have access to the materials I've been using for this project, is currently on hold, maybe some day in the distant future I will continue with it.
